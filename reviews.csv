"GAP3","Great Purchase!","I got this based on reviews plus my daughter wanted a solid battery charger for her iPhone 14 Pro Max because she doesn’t like the mag chargers. This came partially charged. Love the soft texture feel, not any heavier than a mag charger but larger. It was the exact size of my iPhone 13. The optional multi charge abilities was also a plus. We purchased another quality known brand mag first but couldn’t even get it to charge or turn on. It went back immediately and we got this. My daughter loves the paw battery indicator light. Hopefully it works long term. It had a link you could scan for video, instructions, and other products, and support in addition to the paperwork included. It also came with cable and soft mesh bag to carry it in. So far upon opening and first charge we are very happy with this purchase. Simple, lightweight, easy to use charger what’s not to love?","5.0","February 28, 2024","Black","Verified Purchase","10.817755102040817"
"BrokeBuck","Great and Sleek Charger!","I got this since my older battery chargers were on their way out. I saw this one and wanted to try it out, and needless to say after a while of using this battery, its wondeful! This battery has a lot of flexibility -- 3 overall ports that all allow charging. The USB C port that allows you to charge the battery also allows you to charge your devices which is a great advantage to other batteries. It does its job wondefully and charges my phone (Android in this case) in a reasonable time compared to my other charging ports. Its very easy to tell when your battery is low and comes with a cute pouch! It fits in your pockets seamlessly. It also has a little built in flashlight, which, I don't use often but definitely comes into clutch sometimes. I would recommend keeping the battery out of its mesh pocket when charging. It heats up a little when charging but only near the area of charging. As well, the charging cord for the battery is a bit on the shorter side but still can charge on any personal USB C cords. I would recommend this battery for anyone!","5.0","March 4, 2024","Black","Verified Purchase","11.026609195402298"

"Angelsmom","Buying a new one","I bought this May 2021 and it's lasted this long. I love how compact it is. Never had a problem with charging it or charging anything with it. I have an Motorola edge and it has worked great with it. I was able to get several charges from it before it needed to be charged. I'm about to go on a cruise in a few weeks and I planned to take it with me but unfortunately it has stopped charging all the way. I've had it plugged in for hours and it's only gotten as far as the bottom pad on the paw print. No toes light up anymore. It will only charge my phone once now before it runs out. Still keeping it because it basically still works but I'm getting a new one. Hopefully the new one will work just as good.","4.0","March 5, 2024","Black","Verified Purchase","8.036201550387597"
"Mark Wojcik","Very Good Inexpensive Power Bank","I was pleased to see this included in an independent review of power banks just after I bought it, and it was the best among the inexpensive models. Its output is good, its actual capacity is good. It charges well, and the paw-print power indicator works properly. It's a good size for carrying in a pocket (if your clothes have real pockets) and comes with a protective mesh bag. It feels very solid, but it's not as heavy as a good higher-capacity unti (go figure), so it's not a pain to carry around.","5.0","February 14, 2024","Black","Verified Purchase","10.942172413793102"

"Sharon B","Very convenient","I bought this for a week-long cruise and it was very useful and convenient. Super simple to use and kept my phone charged when I needed it. I took a lot of photos on my trip and this reliably kept my phone charged. It's so light and slim that I could connect it to my phone and then put both in my hoodie pocket or cross-body bag. I didn't use the little flashlight feature but it's a cute option, as is the paw print indicator of how much charge is left. I bought a short, high-speed charging cable and my phone charged quickly. This product seems sturdy and well-made so I expect it to last throughout future trips.","5.0","February 17, 2024","Black","Verified Purchase","11.01675"
"Yairah","So far, so good ....","It only just arrived! (Don't know why you're asking for a review when I've scarcely unpacked it!) First impressions? It arrived with an 80% charge, which topped off quickly. Love the hand-feel & the bright color & the fact that it has it's own cable; the Paw Power Indicator Light I'm sure will be critical once our vacation begins & the flashlight (!) will certainly be useful, as will its cushion-y net carry bag. There's a solid feeling of quality from the packaging, the Welcome Guide & enclosed ""business card"" listing email & web support addresses, all of which were actually clear & well written. I'm testing its performance for the next month BEFORE we leave on our trip - I'll try to report back once I have actual results in using it doing what I bought it to do! I'm feeling quite optimistic.","5.0","March 3, 2024","Orange","Verified Purchase","11.38695652173913"
"Allen D. Reinecke","Project Farm Tested!","I currently don’t own a portable charger and thought one might be useful if on a long hike, out and about, or on vacation. I did quite a bit of research and saw that Project Farm on YT has reviewed this INUI BI-B41, along with many others, and it was one of the top chargers, also with a good Amazon rating. The brother of this, the BI-B61 came out marginally better but it has above average Amazon returns and the form factor, small but thick, was not as pocketable for my needs. I also didn’t need a vulnerable, built-in phone stand, so, I bought this one. . It arrived with about 50-60% charge. I didn’t time how long it took to fast-charge it, but it was at least an hour. Project Farm has all the details for charging power and times. The supplied, short USB -A to USB-C is obviously not a fast-charging cable for my Pixel 6a. I used my own USB-C to USB-C fast-charge cable and the phone did charge at the anticipated fast-charge rate and was equivalent to my 20W charging brick. I usually only charge between 25% and 80% to prolong the battery life, and to get the quickest charge time (as you approach 100% the charge rate in a phone will automatically drop to a crawl as part of the battery management algorithm). I’ve used the charger on my headphones, phone, and earbuds. I will also use it for my mirrorless camera batteries in the future. It does not get hot. So far, it is working as I expect. It is also similar, in terms of size, to a small phone, so it fits nicely in my pockets. . I’m not keen on the LED “animal paw” symbol. I’d much rather have a row of 4 or 5 LEDs, or a percentage readout. The paw looks childish. Each of the 4 pads indicates the level of charge in 25% increments, and the level of charge has a flashing pad when charging. The LED is very bright in a dark room but you can always turn it on its back. . At $20, this is a very good buy. Hopefully the 3-year warranty, if required, is honored. I will be back to update this review should I have any issues. . So far - Highly recommended for your consideration!","5.0","February 20, 2024","Black","Verified Purchase","10.124623655913979"
"Christine","It works well","I like the slim build. It’s almost the size of my phone. It will charge my phone or iPad up twice before it needs recharging itself. I was hoping I would get more charge out of it than that, but I only use it in case I forgot to charge one of my devices up and have no other means to charge it. It comes with a short cord that is used for recharging it and for charging my android phone, and maybe an android tablet, too, I don’t know as I don’t have one of those. I already had a short usb port iPhone/iPad cord that can be used to charge those devices, otherwise you have to buy one. I am able to charge two devices at the same time. The four stars instead of five is because it doesn’t come with an iPhone/iPad charge cord ( note: this cord has to have one end of it usb port and the other end iPhone/iPad compatible. I bought it on Amazon ) and it doesn’t hold as much charge as my old bulky portable charger that held enough charge to recharge a device 4 times instead of only 2 times. That being said, I didn’t find another device that could either, and I am still happy to have this charger.","4.0","March 4, 2024","Black","Verified Purchase","8.729505208333334"

"Pakou Vue","Reasonable effective capacity vs claimed capacity","Purchased this power bank (INIU B1-B5 20000mAh) due to seeing YouTube review of several PBs where reviewer took apart several PBs and showed that the batteries used in the PBs were actually rated far below the claimed capacities. INIU was one of few brands whose battery (in this case 20000mAh) label actually matched the advertised capacity. IOW, some brands that advertised 20000mAh capacity actually had batteries in them that were listed at 10000mAh etc. I used an old iPhone 7plus (with a 2900mAh battery) to charge from 50% back to 100% (or 1450mAh). The INIU B1-B5 went from 100% down to 86% (test was done three times with same results). Due to voltage conversion from the 3.7v battery to 5v USB output, the effective total capacity of the PB should be around (3.7/5)*20000 or 14800mAh. Since 14% of the PB was used, this amounts to 2072mAh. Since 2072 mAh of output from the PB was used to effectively charge 1450mAh of the phone battery, this amounts to a 70% charging efficiency. This means that I would get around 3.57 charges of my old iPhone 7plus out of this 20000mAh battery power bank. IIRC, I read somewhere that the expected efficiency of power banks should average around 80-85% due to conversion losses. At 70% loss, this power bank does not seem to be every efficient (although in my test, this may be due in part to the fact that the phone used is an old one). The positives: This power bank did charge my phone from 50% to 100 % in 1hr 57min which is pretty good given the iPhone 7plus is not fast charge (PD) capable. In my short time with the INIU, it seems to hold a charge well, did not heat up and did not heat up the phone while charging. It was also consistent in the charge times. The neutrals: While the thickness and weight of the unit does not lend itself to carry in a pocket while charging your phone (see specs on Amazon page), it is compact enough to easily carry in your carry on luggage as at a rated 74Wh it is well below the 100Wh limit imposed by the FAA and airlines. While it did underperform regarding capacity vs what it is advertised to be able to do, it was not as bad as some of the other power banks I tested, and came the closest to the advertised capacity as compared to some of the others I tested. The negatives: All power banks seem to use misleading specs in their advertising. Just because the power bank has a “20000mah” battery, does not mean that it will charge a device with, say a 4000mAh battery 5 times. Far from this due to various conversion losses etc. Also, I assume that these conversion losses can vary quite a bit between various power banks. While this power bank seems to not be very efficient, it met my needs (especially for the price). Unknowns: I have only just gotten this power bank and have only used it 4 times to charge my phone from 50% back to 100%. I anticipate using it primarily for travel. I have read reviews warning of battery pack swelling and failure etc over time. I have not had any problems with it so far but have used it for less than one week. So time will tell. In the meantime, my spouse also bought one as well so we will see.","4.0","October 18, 2023","Black","Verified Purchase","8.420423892100192"
"GG","What a Gem In a Hurricane or Stuck in an Airport!","LOVE this charger. I have never used a portable power pack before, but bought this one as a hurricane was approaching three years ago. I guess I got lucky because this one has been a gem. If you know electronics, you can skip this, but if you are like me and figure things out as you go, here is what you need to know. You attach this with a cord to a wall outlet to charge it. You could use the included cord, although it is very short. Put the USB-C (smaller) end into the in/out port (hole), and then plug the larger end (called USB-A) into the square'ish block that is on the end of your telephone charging cord. Then plug that into the wall and this will power up your INIU portable charger. The little blue paw print will come on and you can watch it charge, from one light to five (fully charged). Mine never takes very long to charge, but it's never really drained. (I hear you should use most of the charge before recharging to maintain life of the charger, but I cannot control when a hurricane is coming, and that's usually when I charge it.) When you need to power your device, you will connect it to the charged INIU power pack. You will now use any of the OUT ports (holes) in on the INIU to connect the charger to your device. You might have to use the cord that comes with your phone to do this if your phone does not use a USB C plug. Simply detach that cord from the square box that you plug into the wall and put that end (USB A) into OUT 1 or OUT 2, and the other end into your phone. Your phone should now be charging from the power pack. The blue ""Paw"" lights will indicate that the power pack is in use and how much charge is left in it. If I have confused you, I promise it will make more sense to you when you actually do it. Remember the IN port is for electricity to come INto the INIU to charge the INIU. The OUT ports are for the INIU to send OUT power to your device. Be sure to do this BEFORE you desperately need it. I have dropped this multiple times, including on my garage floor, without damage. It is the size of my smart phone, but a tad thicker. It charges my phone fully twice before I need to charge the INIU power pack again. I assume you can also charge this in the USB port in your car, although anything I ever plug in there seems to take a long time to charge, so on the way to the airport might be a little late. This has saved me in power outages, but also in other circumstances. I was stuck in the Instanbul Airport with a massive amount of people and not a plug to be found. I was able to charge my USB powered sonic electric toothbrush with this when I forgot to charge the toothbrush at home. I gave one to my handicapped mother for her Kindle, in case she ran out of battery and did not want to fight getting up to plug the Kindle in. If all else fails, if you go to the ratings/comments/questions section for this item, you will find a user guide and manual hidden there. But since I did not understand the in/out and different kinds of USB plugs, I was lost for a while.","5.0","August 26, 2023","Black","Verified Purchase","9.423871951219512"

"Peter Lee","Liked it so much I bought it thrice","I use a back pack on a regular basis to transport my work electronic devices, chargers and office whatnot. On a brief working vacation I took the backpack with me. When I bought the backpack it came with a pocket for a battery bank and a pass through USB-C cord. I bought this, charged it and summarily forgot its existence in my bag for several months. My room at the hotel had poor cellular service, probably because I was on a lower floor. When that happens the phone works harder to maintain service. I forgot to plug my phone in overnight and by morning I was down to 26% power. This is what the little battery backup was made for. After only thirty minutes of charging, my phone was above 70% in power which was sufficient to get me through the next day. I didn't even bother to charge it the full amount. This tiny battery backup saved the day and never asked for a reward! Therefore, this Christmas, I am getting one for my wife as well. She can tuck it in her purse and forget about it until the day she needs it. Update: On a recent trip I left this indispensable gem on a train. Bonus to whomever received it. Still, that train ride to S. Florida only solidified the need for this device. My cheap seat had no charging capability. A more expensive seat would have cost more than this power bank. On that trip I charged my iPad (which was the entertainment for the trip) and my phone which was keeping track of my GPS location for three hours. Now I am purchasing this item for the third time. Not because it broke, but because it works so well.","5.0","December 1, 2023","Black","Verified Purchase","9.744408602150537"

Though it’s small and compact it has its obvious flaws that make this review a 4/5. These flaws include a lower battery life than most others for about the same price. Although it has its advantages its durability is decent for its price and the compact nature of the design makes it a perfect emergency travel tool. My advice is if you are looking for a good travel power bank and only use it for emergency charging I definitely wouldn’t recommend it enough. Though if you’re looking into a multi use power bank and want multiple charges I would pull some more money to buy a more expensive and convenient power bank to use.","4.0","February 6, 2024","Black","Verified Purchase","8.124814814814815"

"CyberSensei🥋","A Charged Disappointment: Reevaluating the INIU Portable Charger","Embarking on a journey to find the perfect portable charging companion led me to the INIU Portable Charger, a promising device boasting a 10000mAh capacity coupled with USB-C in & out technology for high-speed charging. Designed to be the power lifeline for a range of devices from the iPhone 15 to the Samsung S22, its sleek form and robust specs appeared tailor-made for the demands of a modern, mobile lifestyle. However, as the glossy sheen of initial impressions faded, the reality of daily use painted a starkly different picture. The integration of the INIU Portable Charger into my tech routine revealed several significant flaws, starkly contrasting with the high expectations set by its advertised capabilities. This stark discrepancy prompted a thorough reassessment of its effectiveness and utility in my digital ecosystem. Pros: 🌐 Versatile Compatibility: Initially, the charger’s compatibility was its most appealing feature, promising seamless integration with a wide array of devices. This universal compatibility was a beacon of convenience, envisaged to simplify the charging needs of my tech-laden life. Envisioning a world where a single charger could meet all my devices' energy needs, the INIU Portable Charger seemed like a dream accessory, eliminating the need for multiple chargers and simplifying my tech setup. Cons: Questionable Capacity: Despite its promising 10000mAh capacity, the charger's actual performance was underwhelming. It consistently struggled to fully recharge my devices, often depleting its stored power after a single use. This glaring discrepancy between advertised and real-world capacity became a source of frustration, leaving me in need of additional charging solutions far sooner than expected. The reliability I sought in a portable charger was compromised, as the INIU Portable Charger failed to deliver the endurance and dependability it promised, making it difficult to trust as a primary power source for important devices. Pros: 💼 Sleek Design: The design of the INIU Portable Charger was undoubtedly its strong suit. Its slim, lightweight profile made it an attractive and practical choice for inclusion in daily carry, promising not to add unnecessary bulk. The aesthetic appeal of the charger, with its modern lines and minimalistic style, was designed to complement the array of devices it was intended to support, suggesting that functionality and form had been considered in equal measure. This thoughtful design was a reminder that portable power could indeed be both effective and elegant, fitting seamlessly into both professional and casual contexts. Cons: 🔄 USB-C Limitations: The inclusion of USB-C technology in the charger was a key selling point, suggesting a step forward in charging efficiency and speed. However, the reality was a letdown. The USB-C port's performance fell short of current standards, with charging and data transfer speeds lagging behind those of other devices in my tech arsenal. This underperformance was particularly noticeable during critical moments when fast charging was not just preferred but necessary. The slow recharge rate via USB-C, a standard I had come to rely on for its rapid power delivery, meant that the charger was often bypassed in favor of more reliable alternatives, undermining its position as a go-to charging solution. Reflecting on the experience with the INIU Portable Charger, it's evident that while it promised to be an all-encompassing power solution, the reality was a blend of style over substance. The sleek design and broad device compatibility initially suggested a future where charging concerns were alleviated. Yet, the shortcomings in capacity and the underwhelming USB-C performance highlighted significant gaps between its potential and actual utility. This journey from anticipation to disappointment underscores the critical need for portable chargers to not only meet but exceed the demands of the modern digital landscape. As I continue the search for a truly reliable portable charger, the lessons learned from the INIU Portable Charger experience remain front and center. The quest for a device that seamlessly marries form with function, offering dependable, high-speed charging without compromise, goes on. Here's to hoping the next charger not only matches but surpasses expectations, keeping our devices—and by extension, our lives—powered and uninterrupted.","1.0","March 8, 2024","Black","Verified Purchase","1.875024154589372"

It was evening when it unexpectedly went out, so our phones weren’t close to fully charged. In fact, my son’s phone was at 9%. Not wanting to trudge out into a snow storm and severe cold, I teased that I’d grab this charger to try. I hadn’t touched it or charged it since the end of July, when his baseball season ended. I’d used it mind you, to record an entire game before packing it away. 5 months later, out of the closet, this battery pack was still over half charged!!

It also comes with a little pouch which is quite nice. By the way, it's a smaller than my phone and thus fits in my pocket. I looked over all the similar Power Banks and for this price range (inexpensive), you get much more for your money than any others I saw.

It feels quality and should work great for the heated vest I purchased it to power. I did an ah test on one of the batteries, like I do for ALL lithium batteries. The test showed that these batteries DO NOT have the rated power in them. My test produced 6.07 ah of power. These are rated for 10,000 mah which is 10 ah's. These are really rated at 6,000 mah. The price is nice but it you want full power then I suggest going with a different brand. I may return these and get ones that hopefully test out to their rated power. This is something we consumers need to watch. We can be duped so easily when it comes to lithium batteries. I make sure all of my lithium batteries have their full capacity.

"Tiffany","Bought a second one…","Bought a second one because it’s a popular product in my house. It works great, is nice and thin, and has a cute case to put it in when you’re not using it! Highly recommend!","5.0","March 5, 2024","Black","Verified Purchase","10.448846153846153"
